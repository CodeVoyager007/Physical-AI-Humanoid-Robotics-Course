# Research: Hackathon Bonus Pack

## 1. Expected Scale and Scope

**Decision**: For the hackathon, we will assume a small scale of 100 concurrent users.
**Rationale**: This is a hackathon project and does not require large-scale deployment. This assumption allows us to focus on functionality rather than performance optimization.
**Alternatives considered**:
- **Large scale (10,000+ users):** Would require more complex infrastructure, load balancing, and database optimization, which is out of scope for the hackathon.
- **Medium scale (1,000 users):** Still requires more performance considerations than necessary for this project.
