# Product Requirements Document (PRD): RoboLearn Handbook

**Document Status**: Published
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-02

## 1. Introduction & Vision

**Problem**: There is a significant knowledge gap between traditional software/AI development and the multi-disciplinary field of modern robotics. Aspiring robotics engineers lack a comprehensive, high-quality, and modern educational resource that covers the entire stack from simulation to deployment.

**Vision**: To create the **premier open-source handbook for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**. RoboLearn will be the go-to resource for students and engineers, empowering them to build and understand the next generation of intelligent machines.

## 2. Product Goals & Objectives

-   **Primary Goal**: Educate users on the end-to-end workflow of developing AI for physical robots.
-   **Secondary Goal**: Establish a high-quality, visually appealing, and "expensive" looking brand for the RoboLearn platform.
-   **Business Objective**: Drive community engagement and establish the platform as a leading educational resource in the robotics space.

## 3. Target Audience

-   **Primary**: University students in computer science, engineering, or robotics programs.
-   **Secondary**: Professional software engineers and AI practitioners looking to transition into the robotics industry.

## 4. Features & Requirements

### Core Feature: The Handbook
A comprehensive, 31-chapter digital textbook covering four key modules:
1.  **Foundations**: Core concepts of Embodied AI and environment setup.
2.  **ROS 2**: The middleware and "nervous system" of the robot.
3.  **Simulation**: Building "digital twins" in Gazebo and Unity.
4.  **AI & VLA**: Advanced AI with NVIDIA Isaac and Vision-Language-Action models.

### Platform Features:
-   **High-Fidelity Design**: A "Purplish Neon" theme with a global "Grid & Glow" background, animations, and a professional, modern aesthetic.
-   **Responsive Layout**: Fully accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
-   **Interactive Elements**: A floating robot mascot on the homepage and animated UI components.
-   **Future-Ready**: Architecture prepared for future integration of a context-aware chatbot.

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

-   **Engagement**:
    -   Time on site per user.
    -   Number of chapters read per session.
    -   Community contributions (e.g., GitHub stars, forks, issues).
-   **Adoption**:
    -   Monthly active users.
    -   Referrals from academic institutions or industry blogs.
-   **Quality**:
    -   Successful build rate (must be 100%).
    -   User survey feedback on content clarity and design quality.

## 6. Out of Scope (For This Version)

-   User accounts and progress tracking.
-   Interactive coding environments.
-   A fully functional chatbot (only the placeholder is included).
-   Video tutorials or forums.
